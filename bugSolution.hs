The solution involves either mapping the list of functions to a list of values or using a different approach that avoids applying length directly to a list of functions. One solution could be to apply each function to an argument and then compute the length of the resultant list.  If the functions themselves are not of interest,  a simple solution is to just ignore the functions and create a list of the same length, populated with dummy values.  This approach focuses on fixing the immediate problem and avoiding unnecessary complication.
